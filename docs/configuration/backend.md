# Backend Configuration

## Backend Setup Check

After configuring the backend Agent, you can run a unified read-only check:

```bash
qwenaudio setup
```

It checks the backend executable, ACP integration method, and necessary Adapters, and clearly
displays the current selection. The check command itself does not install or download the backend
Agent, does not trigger login, and does not output or validate credentials or modify model
configuration. It indicates whether OpenCode/OpenClaw can automatically download and configure
itself at formal startup; the configuration status of other backends is managed by the Agent
itself.

To check only a specified backend or get machine-readable results:

```bash
qwenaudio setup --backend codex
qwenaudio setup --json
```

The JSON output uses the same shared detection module as the CLI, which can be directly reused
by the desktop edition and other tools.

## One-Click Installation of Backend Agents

Backend Agents that are not installed can be installed on the local machine using a unified
command:

```bash
qwenaudio install codex
qwenaudio install deepseek
```

- Before installation, it detects and only fills in missing components: a native ACP backend is
  ready to use once installed; if the main body is missing, it installs the main body; if the
  main body is installed but only the ACP adapter is missing, it installs only the adapter; if
  everything is ready, it directly prompts that it is available.
- The installation specification (official npm packages with locked versions, official
  installation scripts) is shared between the CLI and desktop edition from the same definition;
  versions are consistent with the managed launcher scripts under `scripts/`; they can be
  overridden with corresponding environment variables, such as `OPENCODE_PACKAGE`,
  `CODEX_ACP_PACKAGE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ACP_PACKAGE`.
- ACP adapters for Codex and Claude Code are provided together with the main body; Hermes uses
  the official installation script. Script-type steps display the full command before execution
  and wait for confirmation; `--yes` skips confirmation (use with caution).
- After installation, backend availability is detected again automatically; backends that need
  initialization, login, or credentials expose one consistent **Configure** action.
- The generic `acp` backend does not provide one-click installation; please install it yourself
  and configure it via `ACP_COMMAND`.
- In the "Backend Agent" list on the desktop edition settings page, backends that are not
  installed and support one-click installation will display an "Install" button at the end of
  the row, using the same installation logic as the CLI; script-type installations will pop up
  a native confirmation dialog.

Desktop provides a shared shell for installation, configuration, and connection state without
encoding any Agent-specific login flow. Each backend onboarding adapter declares its trusted
configuration entry and status probe. An adapter may open a terminal today and can later provide
a browser, form, or instructions action without changing product-specific logic in Settings.
The renderer submits only a backend ID and can never assemble or execute configuration commands.

After installing DeepSeek Harness,
run `dsh web` and configure the official API key in its model settings. The ACP
integration reuses that credential. Its model setting is intentionally separate
from other backends so Qwen or other provider model names are not forwarded to DeepSeek:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=deepseek
# Optional: deepseek-v4-pro (default) or deepseek-v4-flash
DEEPSEEK_HARNESS_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro
```

`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` may still be set as an explicit per-run override.

### Windows source debugging with DeepSeek

Run in PowerShell at the repository root with Node.js and npm installed:

```powershell
npm ci
# Keep local configuration, logs and task data in the ignored runtime/ directory.
$env:QWAUDIO_CONFIG_DIR = Join-Path $PWD 'runtime/local'
$env:QWAUDIO_DATA_DIR = $env:QWAUDIO_CONFIG_DIR
node cli/bin/qwenaudio.mjs install deepseek
```

For the first setup, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Edit an existing file
instead of overwriting it. Change `AGENT_PROTOCOL` to `deepseek` and configure
the following values, keeping only one assignment for each variable:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=deepseek
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_HARNESS_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=
```

Enter a complete DeepSeek key in `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, or run `dsh web` to use the
Harness credential store. A masked key or Tracking ID cannot authenticate.
`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is a separate credential for the default realtime voice
frontend; a DeepSeek key cannot replace it. Select the DeepSeek model through
`DEEPSEEK_HARNESS_MODEL`; no generic backend model override is needed.

```powershell
node cli/bin/qwenaudio.mjs setup --backend deepseek
node server/src/index.mjs
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3101>. The `setup` command checks installation and
configuration without making model requests. A successful real task is still
needed to verify authentication, available balance and model access.

Without a voice key, explicitly opt into the existing UI debugging mode in
the same PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:QWEN_AUDIO_ALLOW_UNCONFIGURED = '1'
$env:AGENT_PROTOCOL = 'none'
node server/src/index.mjs
```

This mode supports UI and Gateway debugging only, without voice conversations
or backend tasks. Stop the process and remove the temporary overrides before
restarting with the real configuration from `.env.local`:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:QWEN_AUDIO_ALLOW_UNCONFIGURED -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:AGENT_PROTOCOL -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
node server/src/index.mjs
```

The Gateway listens on loopback by default. Git ignores `.env.local` and
`runtime/`; inspect `git diff --cached` before submitting a PR to ensure no
credentials or runtime data were staged.

## Skill Management

Backend agents execute the actual tasks, so standard Agent Skills
(`SKILL.md` folders in the open format) are installed for backends.
`qwenaudio skill` is a branded entry point for the community-standard
[skills.sh](https://skills.sh) installer (`npx skills`): every command is a
1:1 passthrough, with one addition — installs target the backends that
actually exist on this machine (CLI detected) plus the currently configured
backend, instead of relying on skills.sh's own agent detection.

```bash
qwenaudio skill install <source> --skill <name>   # install to every backend
qwenaudio skill install <source> --list           # list skills in a source
qwenaudio skill list                              # list installed skills
qwenaudio skill remove <name>                     # remove a skill
qwenaudio skill update                            # update installed skills
```

Supported sources are whatever skills.sh supports:

| Source form | Example |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub shorthand | `qwenaudio skill install vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill web-design-guidelines` |
| Repository URL (GitHub/GitLab/any git) | `qwenaudio skill install https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills --skill skill-security-auditor` |
| Tree URL (skill subdirectory) | `qwenaudio skill install https://github.com/o/r/tree/main/skills/x --skill x` |
| Hub skill page URL | `qwenaudio skill install https://clawhub.ai/thcjp/skills/excel-formula-tool-free --skill excel-formula-tool-free` |
| Local directory | `qwenaudio skill install ./my-skill --skill my-skill` |

For multi-skill repositories `--skill` is required (repeat it to install
several); run `--list` first to see what a source provides. Installing an
entire large catalog at once is intentionally not supported — every skill
description is injected into backend system prompts.

Skills land in each backend CLI's own user-level directory
(`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.qwen/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/`,
`~/.agents/skills/`, …), so they also work when you use those CLIs directly,
and the desktop app and CLI share the same skills.

When you switch to — or newly install — a backend that is missing previously
installed skills, the gateway backfills them synchronously at startup: a
millisecond-level local check against the skills.sh lockfile
(`~/.agents/.skill-lock.json`), and only when something is actually missing a
one-off skills.sh run (a few seconds) before the backend process starts, so
the backend always sees a complete skill set on its first scan. Failures
(for example offline) are logged and never block the voice gateway.

The pinned skills.sh version can be overridden with
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_SKILLS_CLI_PACKAGE` (for example `skills@latest`). If a
newly added backend is not yet supported by skills.sh, contribute an agent
definition to its `src/agents.ts` — that is the official extension point.

### When skills take effect

Files are synced immediately, but each backend discovers new skills on its
own schedule:

| Backend | Discovery | New skill visible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code, Qwen Code, Hermes, DeepSeek | Hot reload (watcher or on-demand read) | Immediately, no action needed |
| Qoder | On session start; `/skills reload` inside a native session | Next backend session |
| OpenCode, OpenClaw, Kimi Code, CodeBuddy, Codex | Snapshot at process or session start | After the backend process restarts |

If a newly installed skill is not picked up, `qwenaudio gateway restart`
restarts the backend process and always resolves it.

### Shared backend workspace

All backends now share one default working directory,
`<config-dir>/workspace`, so switching backends continues the same files
seamlessly. Per-backend overrides (for example `OPENCODE_WORKSPACE`)
still isolate a specific backend when set explicitly.


## Selecting a Backend

`AGENT_PROTOCOL` has no default value and is also an optional configuration. When left blank,
the Gateway only provides frontend real-time voice chat; requests requiring backend execution
will return a clear error without creating tasks or guessing execution results.
You can also use `qwenaudio --backend none` to explicitly start frontend-only mode.

The default OpenClaw address is `http://127.0.0.1:18789`. When
`OPENCLAW_BASE_URL` is set explicitly, qwen-audio-agent connects to that
Gateway as an external black box. It does not start another OpenClaw Gateway
or read, copy, or modify the Gateway's model credentials:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=openclaw
OPENCLAW_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=
```

For a remote deployment, use an `https://` or `wss://` address. Prefer
`wss://` across machines and never embed the token in the URL:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=openclaw
OPENCLAW_BASE_URL=wss://openclaw.example.com
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=replace-with-your-token
```

External mode still starts the lightweight official `openclaw acp` bridge on
the qwen-audio-agent host and speaks ACP over stdio to it. The bridge then
connects to the user-managed remote Gateway. qwen-audio-agent never starts,
stops, reconfigures, or moves that remote Gateway. The official bridge reports
the real network, TLS, and authentication error instead of using the 300 ms
local startup probe. If local security software terminates the bridge, the turn
fails explicitly while the remote Gateway remains untouched.

If local security policy blocks only qwen-audio-agent's OpenClaw launcher,
point to a trusted OpenClaw executable and the Gateway will run the lightweight
bridge directly:

```dotenv
OPENCLAW_ACP_BIN=/absolute/path/to/openclaw
```

This does not change ownership of the remote Gateway. The local process remains
an ACP bridge and is stopped with the qwen-audio-agent Gateway.

When `OPENCLAW_BASE_URL` is not set, it preferentially launches the `openclaw`
in the user environment. When both
`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and `QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL` are provided, an independent Bailian
configuration and state directory is generated for the qwen-audio-agent process, without
modifying the user's native configuration. When no backend model is specified, it inherits the
user's native configuration, models, and authentication, but does not enable external messaging
channels such as DingTalk in the independent instance. In managed mode, if the original configuration
has enabled a Gateway Token, it will be automatically read and used for local ACP connections; it can
also be overridden via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, or `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` can be set to explicitly
specify a different OpenClaw configuration. When connecting to an external Gateway, also set
`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN_FILE`).

That model value is only used to provision a locally managed instance before startup. For an
external OpenClaw Gateway, a Session model override requires its ACP bridge to advertise standard
`configOptions`; the Gateway no longer calls the private OpenClaw `sessions.patch` RPC.

OpenCode: The Gateway interacts with it via `opencode acp` and manages the local service used
to open the native Session interface. When there is no compatible installation, it automatically
uses a fixed npm package; users do not need to separately install or start the service.
`OPENCODE_BASE_URL` names that local Session UI service; it is not a remote ACP execution
endpoint that qwen-audio-agent can attach to:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=opencode
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

Qoder uses the local `qodercli --acp` and has no HTTP backend address:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=qoder
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

The unified ACP Adapter maintains a fixed native coordination Session for each user, and
provides the ability to list, create, continue, query, and cancel project Sessions through
ACP's Session list/resume/new capabilities and dynamic MCP tools. When continuing an existing
project, it executes `session/resume` using the target Session's original `session_id` and
working directory; interactions are appended to the native CLI Session history.

Authentication reuses the `qodercli` current login state or its supported environment variables.
Advanced configuration:

```dotenv
QODERCLI_PATH=
QODER_CONFIG_DIR=
```

The Gateway manages the Qoder ACP subprocess; Qoder does not accept `--backend-url`.

### Qwen Code

Qwen Code connects through its native stdio ACP entry point, `qwen --acp`.
The Gateway starts only this local ACP process and preserves Qwen Code's own
authentication, provider, model, MCP, Skill, and Session configuration.

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=qwen
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

Run `qwen` interactively and use `/auth` for first-time authentication. The
removed `qwen auth` command is not used. Optional overrides:

```dotenv
QWEN_CODE_BIN=
QWEN_CODE_WORKSPACE=
```

The current integration intentionally supports the local ACP process only;
Qwen Code's experimental network service is not treated as a remote backend.

### Kimi Code

Kimi Code ([MoonshotAI/kimi-code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code))
connects via the official native ACP entry point `kimi acp`. The current integration verifies
and requires Kimi Code `0.31.0` or higher; `qwenaudio setup --backend kimi` checks both the
executable and version, and rejects older implementations below the compatible baseline.

You can install the verified version using the official installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code.kimi.com/kimi-code/install.sh | \
  KIMI_VERSION=0.31.0 KIMI_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local" \
  KIMI_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1 bash
```

When you have already completed login through Kimi Code itself, you only need to select the
backend:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=kimi
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

You can also use Kimi Code's official temporary model environment variables to provide a Kimi
Code API Key without modifying `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=kimi
KIMI_MODEL_NAME=kimi-for-coding
KIMI_MODEL_API_KEY=your-kimi-code-key
KIMI_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1
```

`config.env` is created by qwen-audio-agent as a `0600` file readable and writable only by the
current user; writing actual API keys to the repository is prohibited. Kimi Code's native
configuration, OAuth credentials, and Session storage are still managed by Kimi by default;
qwen-audio-agent does not modify these files. Setting `KIMI_CODE_HOME` can explicitly select a
different Kimi data directory, and setting `KIMI_WORKSPACE` can override the coordination
workspace.

When `QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL` is explicitly set, the Gateway overrides the Kimi Session
model via ACP `session/set_config_option` and confirms it takes effect; if left blank, Kimi
selects its own default model. Advanced configuration:

```dotenv
KIMI_CODE_BIN=
KIMI_WORKSPACE=
KIMI_CODE_HOME=
```

Other Agents that support ACP stdio can use the generic entry point:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=acp
ACP_COMMAND=your-agent
ACP_ARGS=["--acp"]
ACP_LABEL=Your Agent
ACP_WORKSPACE=
```

The generic entry point has the Gateway directly manage the ACP subprocess. `ACP_ARGS` is
recommended to be written as a JSON string array so that arguments containing spaces can still
be parsed accurately. It uses standard ACP Sessions and Gateway-provided Session MCP tools, and
does not assume any Agent's private startup, permission, or UI capabilities.

Action systems without ACP can implement `BackendPort` in a custom Node
launcher; see the [Backend Adapter SDK](../reference/backend-adapter-sdk.md). SDK
composition does not add an `AGENT_PROTOCOL` name or let configuration files
dynamically load arbitrary code.

### Hermes

Hermes Agent ([nousresearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent))
comes with an ACP mode; the Gateway starts it using `hermes acp`:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=hermes
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

Hermes uses its own configured model and provider by default. Only when
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL` is explicitly set will the Gateway override its Session
model via ACP. Before first use, you can run `hermes acp --check` to check dependencies.
Advanced configuration:

```dotenv
HERMES_BIN=
HERMES_WORKSPACE=
```

If `session/new` waits for a long time due to an unreachable provider model catalog, you can
exclude unused providers via `model_catalog.excluded_providers` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

### CodeBuddy

CodeBuddy Code (Tencent's `@tencent-ai/codebuddy-code`) uses `codebuddy --acp`. Its ACP mode
requires account authentication; before first use, you should run `codebuddy` interactively
and complete a login via `/login`.

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=codebuddy
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

By default, it directly uses CodeBuddy's existing model configuration. When
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL` is explicit, the Gateway overrides it only through
`session/set_config_option` after CodeBuddy ACP advertises a standard model option; it does not
pass `--model` or generate a project-level `.codebuddy/models.json`. Advanced configuration:

```dotenv
CODEBUDDY_BIN=
CODEBUDDY_WORKSPACE=
CODEBUDDY_MODEL_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions
```

`CODEBUDDY_MODEL_URL` is CodeBuddy's own provider endpoint and does not prove that a Session model
changed; the returned ACP `configOptions` remain authoritative.

### Codex

Codex ([openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)) connects via
[codex-acp](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/codex-acp) maintained by the ACP project.
The launcher script preferentially binds the `codex` already installed in the user environment,
and preferentially uses the installed `codex-acp`; when the adapter is missing, it uses a fixed
version via `npx`.

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=codex
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

By default, it reuses the user's `~/.codex`, login state, and model. An explicit
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL` overrides a Session only through the standard ACP model option;
`CODEX_BASE_URL` configures a custom provider endpoint and no longer writes a model into
`CODEX_CONFIG`. Neither setting modifies the user's configuration file. Advanced configuration:

```dotenv
CODEX_ACP_BIN=
CODEX_ACP_PACKAGE=@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.7
CODEX_ACP_RUNTIME=auto
CODEX_PATH=
CODEX_WORKSPACE=
CODEX_BASE_URL=
```

### Claude Code

Claude Code connects via
[@zed-industries/claude-code-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp)
maintained by Zed. The launcher script preferentially uses the already installed
`claude-code-acp`, otherwise uses a fixed version via `npx`; no separate installation of the
ACP adapter is needed, but Claude Code must be installed and authenticated first.

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=claude
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE=native
```

Model and credentials are managed by Claude Code itself by default, reusing the existing login
state in `~/.claude`; you can also set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Only when
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL` is explicitly set will the Gateway override its Session
model via ACP. Advanced configuration:

```dotenv
CLAUDE_CODE_ACP_BIN=
CLAUDE_CODE_ACP_PACKAGE=@zed-industries/claude-code-acp@0.16.2
CLAUDE_CODE_ACP_RUNTIME=auto
CLAUDE_WORKSPACE=
CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE=
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=
```

Setting `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` switches to a separate configuration directory, requiring separate
authentication in that directory. `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` is only used to override the Claude
Code executable used by the adapter by default.

### Pi

Pi (earendil-works' [pi coding agent](https://pi.dev), npm
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) has no native ACP entry point; it connects via the
community adapter [pi-acp](https://github.com/svkozak/pi-acp). The Gateway spawns
`pi-acp`, which internally launches `pi --mode rpc`; pi-acp requires pi `0.80.4` or
higher.

One-click install installs both the core and the adapter:

```bash
qwenaudio install pi
```

Or install both packages manually:

```bash
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent pi-acp
```

For authentication, run `pi` interactively and complete a login via `/login` (OAuth
with Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot subscriptions), or set official API
key environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
and 30+ other providers); the Gateway passes environment variables through to the
backend process. Then select the backend:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=pi
```

pi-acp supports resuming historical pi Sessions via `session/load`. Advanced
configuration:

```dotenv
PI_BIN=
PI_ACP_BIN=
PI_WORKSPACE=
PI_ACP_RUNTIME=auto
```

- `PI_BIN` / `PI_ACP_BIN` override the pi core and pi-acp adapter executables.
- `PI_WORKSPACE` overrides the working directory (default
  `~/.config/qwaudio/workspace`, shared with the other managed backends).
- `PI_ACP_RUNTIME` (`auto` / `binary` / `package`) controls whether the adapter uses
  a local binary or starts on demand via `npx`.

> **Warning: Pi has no permission approval mechanism.** Pi officially documents "No
> Built-in Sandbox" — read, write, and bash execute directly with the current user's
> privileges — and pi-acp does not implement ACP `session/request_permission`.
> Therefore Pi is **always equivalent to `full` permission**, regardless of
> `QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE`, and no permission confirmation ever
> appears in the voice session. Use it only in trusted projects and trusted prompt
> environments.

The current community adapter accepts ACP `mcpServers` but does not wire them into
Pi. Gateway Session tools and independent third-layer delegation are therefore not
available for this backend; Pi completes work in the current Session with its own
tools.

Kimi Code, Hermes, CodeBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, and Pi all have their ACP subprocesses
directly managed by the Gateway, and do not accept `--backend-url`.

## Backend Permission Modes

`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE` can be set to:

- `native` (default): Permissions are determined and requested by the backend Agent itself;
  the Gateway only forwards them as-is.
- `full`: Explicitly grants the highest permission at startup; the backend can directly execute
  commands, read and write files, without per-request confirmation.

`full` currently supports OpenCode, Qoder, Qwen Code, Kimi Code, Hermes, CodeBuddy, Codex, and
Claude Code. The Gateway automatically approves permission requests initiated by these ACP
backends; in addition, Kimi Code switches to an Auto mode that does not ask again via ACP
Session configuration, Qoder and CodeBuddy CLI use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, OpenCode
sets `permission: "allow"` in the managed process's inline configuration for both the
coordination Agent and task Agents, and Codex uses `agent-full-access` mode. Kimi Code's YOLO
mode may still ask the user, so it is not used to map `full` here.

Pi is a special case: it has no built-in sandbox or permission approval mechanism,
and its adapter pi-acp does not implement ACP `session/request_permission`. Pi
therefore always runs with the equivalent of `full` permissions no matter which
permission mode is configured — this is not "support for `full`" but the absence of
any approval step. Pi declares this through the `alwaysFullPermission` backend
capability: configuration resolution and Gateway health both normalize and display
the effective `full` mode (never the misleading `native`). Use it only in trusted
projects and trusted prompt environments.

OpenClaw's execution authorization is simultaneously constrained by exec approvals, elevated,
and execution host configurations, and cannot be safely and completely expressed by a single
unified switch; when `full` is selected, the Gateway explicitly refuses to start, requiring
separate configuration via OpenClaw's own method. The highest permission amplifies the risk of
misoperation and should only be enabled in trusted projects and trusted prompt environments.
